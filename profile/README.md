Just a bunch of guys from around the world with interests in technology, sharing the pain of programming; but it's mostly just memes and pictures of dogs (occasionally cats).

We sometimes write about our pain...

[wes4m](https://github.com/wes4m): [Hybrid Migration: Native to React Native](https://wes4m.io/posts/rn-migration/)
> At Ejaro, we have been transitioning to React Native over the past two years while continuing to build new features and growing our app. Instead of undertaking a complete rewrite from scratch, we adopted a hybrid approach. This strategy has been successfully implemented by companies like Shopify and others. In this post I go over some of the decision taking approaches, challenges, and solutions we implemented.
Why Move to React Native?



[wes4m](https://github.com/wes4m): [Lessons from a $5 VPS, Bad Design, and a Traffic Spike](https://wes4m.io/posts/5vps/)
> A year ago I duct-taped together, in a couple of days, an app for fun as an experiment. Without putting much thought into its design or scaleability. I then put it to run on a tiny ~$5 VPS. Not expecting more than a few users. It went on to gain users very slowly for a year. Until, fast forward to last month, STUDI&amp;rsquo;s traffic and users spiked nearly 20x in just a few days, and reached 2nd on AppStore&amp;rsquo;s education charts.

[wes4m](https://github.com/wes4m): [Side Project #9837: Visual Nodes Scripting](https://wes4m.io/posts/ta-dataflow-programming/)
> There are many visual programming implementations out there that make approaching some specific tasks easier. One of which is Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s Blueprint&amp;rsquo;s system.
It provides game developers with a way to program visually by connecting different nodes. Each node taking in some inputs, and/or options, doing something with it, then outputting the results. You can also implement your own re-useable nodes using C++. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently turing complete too.
I wanted to make something similar for a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on, which brings us to: Data Flow Programming, Flow Based Programming, Node Graph Architecture, and a thousand other names.

> Use git update-index --assume-unchanged to remove local changes of a Dockerfile from the staging area in a repository, and use &lpar;an ignored&rpar; docker-compose.override.yml to configure xdebug.

[ally](https://github.com/alistaircol): [Basic Cognito user pool with login/logout integration in Laravel, with users/system clients](https://ac93.uk/articles/laravel-integration-with-amazon-cognito/)
> A relatively basic Laravel integration with an Amazon Cognito user pool with two clients. The first client for web users will be used to initiate &lpar;from Laravel&rpar; login/logout on Cognito&amp;rsquo;s hosted UI with email/password. The second client will be for system users, which will generate tokens with email/password through API instead of hosted UI. Finally, a simple console command to decode/verify web and system users&amp;rsquo; JTWs from the user pool&amp;rsquo;s JWKS.
