Just a bunch of guys from around the world with interests in technology, sharing the pain of programming; but it's mostly just memes and pictures of dogs (occasionally cats).

We sometimes write about our pain...

[wes4m](https://github.com/wes4m): [Side Project #9837: Visual Nodes Scripting](https://wes4m.io/posts/ta-dataflow-programming/)
> There are many visual programming implementations out there that make approaching some specific tasks easier. One of which is Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s Blueprint&amp;rsquo;s system.
It provides game developers with a way to program visually by connecting different nodes. Each node taking in some inputs, and/or options, doing something with it, then outputting the results. You can also implement your own re-useable nodes using C++. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently turing complete too.
I wanted to make something similar for a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on, which brings us to: Data Flow Programming, Flow Based Programming, Node Graph Architecture, and a thousand other names.

> &lt;p&gt;Navigating the tech industry as a junior developer can be a daunting task. From learning new technologies to building a strong professional network, there are many challenges that junior developers must overcome. One of the most important strategies for success is listening to your senior developers and asking them for&lt;/p&gt;

> &lt;blockquote&gt;Seems to be possible this time!&lt;br&gt;All of the code used below is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bulb4saur/scraper_limits&quot;&gt;at my github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, we discussed how fast can python make requests in general. I&amp;apos;ve found it not very practical but quite a fast approach only for making requests. Today I&lt;/p&gt;

asyncio, python, rabbitmq, docker, docker-compose, pydantic

> Use git update-index --assume-unchanged to remove local changes of a Dockerfile from the staging area in a repository, and use &lpar;an ignored&rpar; docker-compose.override.yml to configure xdebug.

docker, xdebug, git

[ally](https://github.com/alistaircol): [Basic Cognito user pool with login/logout integration in Laravel, with users/system clients](https://ac93.uk/articles/laravel-integration-with-amazon-cognito/)
> A relatively basic Laravel integration with an Amazon Cognito user pool with two clients. The first client for web users will be used to initiate &lpar;from Laravel&rpar; login/logout on Cognito&amp;rsquo;s hosted UI with email/password. The second client will be for system users, which will generate tokens with email/password through API instead of hosted UI. Finally, a simple console command to decode/verify web and system users&amp;rsquo; JTWs from the user pool&amp;rsquo;s JWKS.

laravel, cognito, terraform

> &lt;blockquote&gt;Not quite there yet...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;apos;s say you need to make requests using python. Python being the flexible language it is, there are quite a few packages that are easy to use and allow you&lt;br&gt;to make requests. Here is in no particular order a list of the most&lt;/p&gt;
