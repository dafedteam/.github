Just a bunch of guys from around the world with interests in technology, sharing the pain of programming; but it's mostly just memes and pictures of dogs (occasionally cats).

We sometimes write about our pain...

> Google launched 8 new TLDs on May 3rd, 2023 for EAP including .zip &lpar;Link&rpar; The security community had fun coming with all kinds of phishing ideas using it.
I made a tool that demonstrated some of this https://20230609.zip. More details and explinations are found in its homepage. The following is just one example of what can be done.
Github repos Many github repos include scripts such as build.sh docker-build.sh install.sh &amp;hellip;

[wes4m](https://github.com/wes4m): [Side Project #9837: Visual Nodes Scripting](https://wes4m.io/posts/ta-dataflow-programming/)
> There are many visual programming implementations out there that make approaching some specific tasks easier. One of which is Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s Blueprint&amp;rsquo;s system.
It provides game developers with a way to program visually by connecting different nodes. Each node taking in some inputs, and/or options, doing something with it, then outputting the results. You can also implement your own re-useable nodes using C++. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently turing complete too.
I wanted to make something similar for a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on, which brings us to: Data Flow Programming, Flow Based Programming, Node Graph Architecture, and a thousand other names.

> A relatively basic Laravel integration with an Amazon Cognito user pool with two clients. The first client for web users will be used to initiate &lpar;from Laravel&rpar; login/logout on Cognito&amp;rsquo;s hosted UI with email/password. The second client will be for system users, which will generate tokens with email/password through API instead of hosted UI. Finally, a simple console command to decode/verify web and system users&amp;rsquo; JTWs from the user pool&amp;rsquo;s JWKS.
