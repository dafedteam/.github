> &lt;p&gt;Navigating the tech industry as a junior developer can be a daunting task. From learning new technologies to building a strong professional network, there are many challenges that junior developers must overcome.

I&amp;apos;ve found it not very practical but quite a fast approach only for making requests. Today I&lt;/p&gt;

> A relatively basic Laravel integration with an Amazon Cognito user pool with two clients. The first client for web users will be used to initiate &lpar;from Laravel&rpar; login/logout on Cognito&amp;rsquo;s hosted UI with email/password. The second client will be for system users, which will generate tokens with email/password through API instead of hosted UI. Finally, a simple console command to decode/verify web and system users&amp;rsquo; JTWs from the user pool&amp;rsquo;s JWKS.

> &lt;blockquote&gt;Not quite there yet...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;apos;s say you need to make requests using python. Python being the flexible language it is, there are quite a few packages that are easy to use and allow you&lt;br&gt;to make requests. Here is in no particular order a list of the most&lt;/p&gt;
